Team 5338 District III Robot Code
=================================

The C++ source for the robot code which implements teleop and autonomous

Autonomus
=========
No Autonomous code is currently implemented

Teleop Controls
===============

Controllers
-----------

### Drive Joysticks
A left and right joystick are used for driving the robot.
The trigger on the right joystick cuts the speed of the motors in half.
This allows for precision driving.

### Function Controller
This controller is currently mapped to left drive controller, waiting on a third controller.
This joystick is used to control various subsystems on the robot.
Currently pressing the trigger causes the ball pickup motors to run.
